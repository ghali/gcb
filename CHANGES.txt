This code is described in the book "Introduction to Geometric Computing"
by Sherif Ghali, Springer-Verlag, 2008.

Release 1.2 --- April 2011
========================================================================

- This release begins the translation of the code from GLOW to Qt.

- Convex polytope classes are no longer specific to solid BSP classes.

- Some minor changes are needed, such as writing #include <limits>
  rather than #include <climits>.

- C++ files now have the suffix cpp rather than C (an IRIX convention
  that is now seldom used).

- CRLF, rather than LF, is now the line ending. This is mainly because
  Mac OS X and Linux accommodate DOS line endings gracefully, but not
  vice-versa.

- Reader & writer functions are now members of the image class.

- Standard library header files are now included last, not first. This
  reveals sooner when a geometry header file omits to include its own
  necessary header files.

- Qt is now gradually used in addition to GLOW. GLOW works perfectly
  on Linux, Cygwin, and Mac OS X, but GLUT (on which GLOW is based) is
  no longer easy to compile on Visual Studio on Windows. Using Qt also
  means that project management (.pro and .pri) and resources (.qrc)
  files can be streamlined between the three operating systems.
  Ideally, the first release would have used Qt, but that would have
  meant imposing a Qt license on readers. Qt was at the time not
  available under LGPL.

- Since almost all classes are parameterized, I had dispensed with
  separating the interface from the implementation, but this is
  sometimes unwieldy. In the future, implementation (still header)
  files will be in separate _inl.h files.

- The files for geometry classes are organized slightly differently,
  by using, for example, "geometry/E2/.." rather than
  "geometry_E2/..".

Bugs:

- By relying on relative paths (such as "../../../objects/"), the code
  restricts the directory from which it can be launched. Qt resources,
  which will also embed data files in the executable, should be used
  instead.

========================================================================
Release 1.1 --- December 2008
========================================================================

- The header files are now included relative to a common root.

- The Postscript class now supports viewports. The class remains
  backwards compatible.

- Tabs are now eliminated from the source files.

========================================================================
Release 1.0 --- February 2008
========================================================================

- Initial release.
